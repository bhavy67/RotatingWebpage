            <p>A long black shadow slid across the pavement near their feet and the five Venusians, very much startled, looked
            overhead. They were barely in time to see the huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a
            nearby building which bore the mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."
            Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase a child the latest
            smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the latest gaming system, you're likely
            not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you
            buy gifts it's important to remember that some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive
            than the initial gift itself.</p>

            <p>He was aware there were numerous wonders of this world including the unexplained creations of humankind that showed the
            wonder of our ingenuity. There are huge heads on Easter Island. There are the Egyptian pyramids. Thereâ€™s Stonehenge. But
            he now stood in front of a newly discovered monument that simply didn't make any sense and he wondered how he was ever
            going to be able to explain it.</p>
